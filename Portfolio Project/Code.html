                <h2>A website About the Ocean</h2>
                <p>This website project was the first website I created in my web design (CS318) course which was cohesive. This was our first assignment where we were tasked with using CSS on a website to make it look like a true website. Personally, I think this was a great starting point for my learning in this class. </p>

                <h2>A website About Twenty One Pilots </h2>
                <p>This website project was my first website which I made completely independently for a lab project. This design was very time consuming and also required a large amount of extra work to complete. This was a great project but it only looks good in web format, because this is before we were taught mobile first coding.</p>

                <p>This website project was an introduction into positioning elements in CSS and somewhat works in mobile format.</p>

                <h2>My first "Client" design</h2>
                <p>This lab project was the first true design project for an "external client", and was genuinely one of my favorite projects I have worked on to date. It was designed fully by myself and fits muiltiple screen size formats. Overall this was a great precursor to my Final project of the semester which was a design for a client of my choice. </p>
